Nespresso
=========

This project is mainly to learn go and to learn more about CPU architecture. My aim is to implement a functioning 6502 processor. Given enough time it might even become a basic but working NES emulator.

The idea for this project came from https://github.com/scottferg/Fergulator. I've written all the code myself (no copy pasta), but a lot of the idea's come from his code.
